# Vehicle Detection Model Project

This repository contains the code for a vehicle detection model created using Matlab. The model uses a deep learning approach to identify vehicles in an image stream.

# Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- Source code - The main Matlab code file and any supporting files required to run the model.
- Examples - A set of sample images and videos that demonstrate the model's capabilities.

# How to Use

To run the vehicle detection model, you will need to have Matlab installed on your local machine. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the source code file in Matlab and run it. You can also modify the code to adapt the model to your specific needs.

# Requirements

To run the vehicle detection model, you will need the following software:

- Matlab - The model was developed and tested using Matlab R2022a.
- Image Processing Toolbox - This toolbox provides the necessary functions for image and video analysis.

# Background

- The vehicle detection model was developed as a university project to explore the capabilities of deep learning for image and video analysis. 
- The code used in this repository was adapted from the example provided by MathWorks on the following page: [Train a Deep Learning Vehicle Detector](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/train-a-deep-learning-vehicle-detector.html).

# Note

Please note that this repository is for educational and research purposes only and is not intended for commercial use. The code and model provided in this repository are not guaranteed to be error-free and may not reflect best practices for deep learning and image analysis. Use at your own risk.
